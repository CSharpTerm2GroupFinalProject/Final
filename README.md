<h3>Project </h3>
This project is a mash-up of the two classic games of Pong and Air Hockey. Our game has a 2 player mode and a 1 player with CPU opponent mode. From the main menu, you can select which mode you'd like to play. After every collision of the puck, its speed will either increase or decrease. After every score, the speed will reset to what is was originally. You control Player 1 with the WASD keys and Player 2 with the arrow keys.

<h3> Installing</h3>

* Instructions on how to install or download the program. 

* Click the download zip button and extract the file to a location that you determine. 

* Open the .exe file through the file location Final/Final/Final/bin/Debug.

<h3> Word of Warning</h3>
<h5> If the .exe file won't open after it has been previously opened </h5>
  
  * After opening and closing the .exe file, you may need to open the task manager and end the "Final (32-bit)" task. For some reason it stays open even after being closed by the user. We are actively looking into this issue now.
